      { type: "text", text: "✅ **Modern Aesthetic with Customization Options** – Aluminum pergolas are designed for **contemporary outdoor spaces**, offering **minimalist structures, clean lines, and various color finishes**. Unlike wood, **aluminum can be powder-coated in multiple shades, such as Dark Bronze and White**, to match your home’s exterior." },
      { type: "text", text: "✅ **Eco-Friendly & Sustainable Choice** – Aluminum is **100% recyclable**, making it a more **sustainable** option than wood, which requires **tree harvesting**.
